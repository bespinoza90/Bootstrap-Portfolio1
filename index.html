                    <p>Hi, my name is Bobby Espinoza. I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. I currently live in Chandler, Arizona with my fiance and our seven animals! We have three dogs, one cat, one tortoise and two birds.

                        After high school I went to The Conservatory of Recording Arts where I got my certificaion in Audio Engineering. Although I didnt pursue a career in that field, I still enjoy it as a hobby. I played many musical intruments in high school and also played in several bands playing the drums or piano.
                        
                        I currently drive semi trucks and have been doing so for 5 years now. I was always interested in web development and coding, but never had the opportunity until now. I hope to learn as much as I can while attending this bootcamp and maybe take the next step towards my career change! </p>
